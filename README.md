### Approximating Multi-Perspective Trace Alignment Using Trace Encodings (BPM 2023)

1. 'prepare_bs_encoding.ipynb' 

    This script shows the processes (i) to generate non-complying traces by modifying the original traces, (ii) to save ground truth of original traces before modification, (iii) to encode the prepared experimental datasets.

2. Folder 'non_schatistic' includes datasets in non-stochastic setting and experimental codes

    This script shows (i) the approximate approach of multi-perspective alignment and (ii) the results by implementing it (the summary of the results is seen in table 3~6 in our paper).
